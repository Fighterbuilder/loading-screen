# Garry's Mod Loading Screen

A fixed up replica of the default Garry's Mod loading screen without the unnecessary code.

The code was originally taken from the [Garry's Mod GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod/tree/master/garrysmod/html), I deleted all unnessasary files then updated the code for modern web browsers.

A preview of this is available [here](https://conspiracy-servers.github.io/loading-screen/).
